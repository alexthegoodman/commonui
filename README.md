# CommonUI

CommonUI is intended to be a lightweight, yet powerful and performant GUI kit for Rust, particularly for use in games and high-performance software. It is inspired by Rust's Floem. So far, it is 99% vibecoded with Claude Code (with my guidance, of course).

Goals:

- High-performance: 60FPS (game-ready)
- Thread-safe State and Reactivity

Libraries:

- Vello
- Taffy
